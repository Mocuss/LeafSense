# LeafSense
Computer Vision Project: <br>
The project was too big, we needed to put it on google colab. <br>
Download the project from here! <br>

## Objectives:
To create a computer vision model that can accurately identify leaf species and diseases.
## Deliverables:
1. App and models: Only interact with app.py. Use Visual Studio code and open the entire folder, then run app.py only. Use the user manual as reference.
2. Slides
3. User Manual: please use this as reference on how to operate the code
4. Datasets- the original dataset and the segmented dataset
